### **Chatbot Project**

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple rule-based chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a neural network model built with TensorFlow. The chatbot is trained to recognize basic intents, such as greetings and farewells, and respond with predefined messages.

---

### **Features**
- **Dataset**: A JSON-based dataset (`intents.json`) containing intents, patterns, and responses.
- **Preprocessing**: Tokenization and lemmatization of input text for creating a Bag-of-Words model.
- **Neural Network**: A multi-layer perceptron model for intent classification.
- **Interactive Responses**: Generates responses based on predicted intents.
- **Extensibility**: Easy to expand with more intents, patterns, and responses.

---

### **Tech Stack**
- **Python Libraries**: 
  - NLTK for text preprocessing
  - TensorFlow for training the model
  - NumPy for data manipulation
  - Flask (optional, for deployment)
- **Dataset Format**: JSON
- **Model**: Dense Neural Network with softmax activation for multi-class classification.

---

### **Usage**
1. **Training**: Preprocess data and train the model to classify intents.
2. **Response Generation**: Predict intents based on user input and generate responses.
3. **Deployment**: The chatbot can be deployed using Flask or any web framework for real-time interaction.

---

### **Future Enhancements**
- Integration with state-of-the-art models like GPT for better context handling.
- Support for multilingual interactions.
- Deployment as a web-based chatbot or integration into messaging platforms.

---

### **How to Run**
- Clone the repository and follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the `README.md`.
- Train the model and start interacting with the chatbot through the terminal.
